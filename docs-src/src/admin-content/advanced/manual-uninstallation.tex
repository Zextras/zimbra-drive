\begin{warning}
    Manual uninstallation is not supported.

    Please consider to disable the Zimbra Drive (see: \ref{==sec:disablePackages==}) instead of uninstalling it.
    Any modification to the installed zimbra packages may lead to a fail during the Zimbra upgrade.
\end{warning}

The manual uninstallation process of Zimbra Drive Zimlet and Zimbra Drive Extension requires to undeploy zimlet and clean extension folder from zimbra.

Remove Zimbra Drive zimlet:
\begin{verbatim}
# As zimbra
zmzimletctl undeploy com_btactic_drive_open
\end{verbatim}
Remove Zimbra Drive Extension:
\begin{verbatim}
# As root
rm -rf /opt/zimbra/lib/ext/zimbradrive/

# As zimbra
zmmailboxdctl restart
\end{verbatim}
The last but not necessary step is to clean the domain attribute with the command\\
\texttt{zmprov md domainExample.com zimbraDriveOwnCloudURL ""}
